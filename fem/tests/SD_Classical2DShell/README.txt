Solve linearized 2-D shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case of 
a straight cylindrical shell with membrane-dominated asymptotic behaviour.
The problem has been described in Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell deformation states 
and the finite element method: a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. 
Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121. Here
the shell equations are written in lines of curvature coordinates (y1 = 
angular direction, y2 = axial direction) and a special solver code is
employed to handle the problem using the exact surface parametrization.

This test provides a case for verification of the p-version of FEM.
Note that now Elmer uses economic quadrature rules for element definitions
"p:k" with 1 < k <= 8.

The energy norm of the error for different p-element definitions (over the
same 2 X 2 mesh) is found to be as follows (the shell thickness d=0.1):

Note that, except for the case p=2, the current version of Elmer doesn't 
offer a way to obtain an approximation based on the space Q_{p} of polynomials
of degree at most p in each variable separately, since Elmer doesn't employ
the bubbles corresponding to Q_{p}. For example the p-approximation space 
S_{p=8} of Elmer has 15 bubble functions and includes only Q_{4}. 
A deterioration of accuracy may thus happen over non-affine finite elements. 
The results above also show the error when the bubble augmentation 
corresponding S_{p=8} is used in connection with p-elements of lower order. 

For a very high p errors from floating-point arithmetic may limit the 
obtainable accuracy.
