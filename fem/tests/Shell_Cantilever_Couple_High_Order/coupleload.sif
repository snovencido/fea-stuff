!
! A benchmark problem where a cantilever is subject to a moment load at an end.
! The reference results can be found in Sze KY, Liu XH, Lo SH. Popular 
! benchmark problems for geometric nonlinear analysis of shells. Finite 
! Elements in Analysis and Design 2004, 40(11):1551-1569.
!
! Here the problem is solved by using a high-order discretization which switches
! to a special formulation (sets automatically "Cartesian Formulation = 
! Logical True"). The command "Dead Loads = Logical False" is essential so that
! the load is defined to depend on the current deformation.
