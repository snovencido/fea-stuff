! Solve nonlinear shell equations in the case of a cylindrical benchmark 
! problem with bending-dominated asymptotic behaviour in the linear regime. 
! The linearized problem has been described in Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell 
! deformation states and the finite element method: a benchmark study of 
! cylindrical shells. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 
! 1995. 128:81-121. As opposed to the reference, here the shell
! problem is treated as nonlinear, but the shell is subject to a small load 
! so that nonlinear effects are not yet significant.
!
! Here the problem is solved by using a high-order discretization over a 2-D
! domain. This option needs a special command "Skip Surface Reconstruction = 
! True" so that instead of using a physical surface mesh the surface 
! parametrization is described by the subroutine SurfaceBasis within the solver
! code ShellSolver.F90. Working without a physical surface mesh is limited to
! some special geometries which allow a parametrization by lines of curvature
! coordinates. There are other tests for general shell modelling based on
! physical surface meshes.
